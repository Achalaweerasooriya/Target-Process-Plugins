You made me realise that life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was worth living<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- so i gave it one more try<br />
All my faith I put in you, time after time you proved yourself so true<br />
You're the devil, take off the D it spells evil and that make me so happy<br />
All your words they give me strength and i'm e-v-i-l confident<br />
<br />
